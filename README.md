# ThirtySix Studio Clone 🚀

😳 **AI Used for This Floating Canvas Effect!**  
I just completed cloning ThirtySix Studio using **React, GSAP, Framer Motion, Tailwind** – and AI made it crazy fast & easier! 😍🔥

This website is really 🌶️ 🥵 AI can do it even faster, but no worries 😎🥤 – I took my time to match animations & hover effects and completed all the pages myself.  
This is one of the most fun projects I’ve built! **I NEED MORE projects like this!** 🤩
